# UnityDataManager
DataManger for Unity3D

This is a Data Manager for Unity 3D. This is just an example to help how to develop an easy way to manage level atributes for your 
characters, npcs, weapons, items etc.

Hope you like it!

To use just go to Assets -> Import Packages -> Custom Packages -> Choose the file.

Thanks
